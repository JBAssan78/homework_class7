Introduction

This project provides a step-by-step guide to creating an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance using the AWS Management Console. It walks you through each stage of the process so that anyone — even without prior AWS experience — can follow along and successfully launch their own virtual server in the cloud.

You’ll learn how to set up a web-server development environment on AWS, configure key settings, and understand the deliverables involved. The guide also includes troubleshooting tips for common issues, ensuring a smooth and repeatable experience when creating EC2 instances.

By the end, you’ll have a fully functional cloud-based virtual server ready for development and testing.

What You’ll Learn

Step 1

Sign into AWS management console, click on “sign into console”. This will bring you to your IAM user sign in page. Fill in your account ID, IAM username and password and press enter.

You can also sign in using your root user email. On the AWS sign-in page, click the option “Sign in using root user email” — this will display two sign-in options: Root user and IAM user. Select the appropriate option for your account, click Next, and then enter your credentials to sign in.
