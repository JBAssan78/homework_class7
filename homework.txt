Introduction
This project provides a step-by-step guide to creating an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance using the AWS Management Console. It walks you through each stage of the process so that anyone — even without prior AWS experience — can follow along and successfully launch their own virtual server in the cloud.
You’ll learn how to set up a web-server development environment on AWS, configure key settings, and understand the deliverables involved. The guide also includes troubleshooting tips for common issues, ensuring a smooth and repeatable experience when creating EC2 instances.
By the end, you’ll have a fully functional cloud-based virtual server ready for development and testing.
